Question 1 - 
1. Big O time is based the highest value in the equation for the search, such as for sequential search the big o is just X or bubble x^2
2. The big O complexity is for sequential search is just X
3.The big O complexity for binary search is logx
4.the big O complexity for bubble search, selection search, and insertion search is X^2
5. The big o time for binary search is the shortest, sequential being second shortest, and 

Question 2 - 
There seemed to be no real connection between length of array and the average time taken to search for a value;
