For storing the applicants I used a binary search tree since it rather easy to set up using the java api, has no set limit on the amount of data that can be added and allows for quick insertion and search(logN)
For holding the words i used a hashtable since we already know how many words will be added to the hashtable through reading the textfile, so we can create a hastable acordingly to match the length. It also gives the fastest search time at 1(potentially if there is no collisions) which is the fastest we can get.
For the queue for the waitlist i used a priority que with a heap since it allows and infinite amount of data to be added as long as there is memory
