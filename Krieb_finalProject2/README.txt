For storing the applicants I used a binary search tree through the tree map api(to have the email be the key) since it rather easy to set up using the java api, has no set limit on the amount of data that can be added and allows for quick insertion and search(logN)
For holding the words i used a hashset since we already know how many words will be added to the hashset through reading the textfile, so we can create a hashset acordingly to match the length. It also gives the fastest search time at 1(potentially if there is no collisions) which is the fastest we can get. I didnt use a hashmap since there are no other values to be put in besides the string value
For the queue for the waitlist i used a priority que with a heap since it allows and infinite amount of data to be added as long as there is memory
For things like holding the values for states for the combobox or for holding the individual words in the essay i used linkedlists since they allow for an pottentiall infinite amount of data to be put into them and keeps the original input sequence which other data structures dont
